Polyglot is a collection of examples of programs written in several programming languages.

Introduction
============

Reasons to use several programming languages in the same program:

- reuse: a new program calls an existing codebase in another language
- sharing: the same code runs on several environments
- performance: a part of a program is compiled natively for execution speed while other parts are interpreted to ease development

Vocabulary:

- the 'host' language has the execution entry point controls the flow of execution
- the 'guest' language has a function to be called by the host
